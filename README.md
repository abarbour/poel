# Tools to work with poroelastic modeling results from _poel_, in R

_poel_ is a FORTRAN code by R.Wang (https://goo.gl/wA8iKR; direct download of version 2012: https://goo.gl/NSv96i)
that can be used to simulate fully coupled fluid-strain processes associated with injection of
extraction of fluid from a layered poroelastic halfspace.
    
# Development needs
====
* add normalization attributes to sensitivity functions
* robustify lithology functions
